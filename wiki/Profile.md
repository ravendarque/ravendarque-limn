---

## name (required)

What people see. Real name, handle, stage name — your call.

---

## bio (optional)

A line or two. Write it like you're introducing yourself to someone at a party.

---

## image (optional)

**Local file:** `avatar.jpg` — drop it in the repo root. Replace the default or add your own and point to it.

**URL:** `image: https://example.com/my-photo.jpg` — works too.

**Skip it?** Limn shows your initials in a coloured circle. Looks clean.
