# Limn

A self-hosted, no-build bio and links page. One YAML file. Edit it. Deploy it.

**[→ Documentation (Wiki)](https://github.com/ravendarque/ravendarque-limn/wiki)** — everything you need.

**Quick start:** [Configurator](https://ravendarque.github.io/ravendarque-limn/configurator.html) — fill in your details, download a zip, deploy anywhere. Or grab the [release zip](https://github.com/ravendarque/ravendarque-limn/releases) and edit `config.yaml` yourself.

No Node. No build step. No subscriptions.

---

**Repo layout:** `site/` = deployable (configurator, engine, themes, tiles). Root = project meta (wiki, .cursor).
