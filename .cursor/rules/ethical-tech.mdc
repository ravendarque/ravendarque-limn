# Tech stack and BDS boycott list

When adding dependencies, CDNs, services, or recommending tools:

- **Do not use** technology from the BDS Movement boycott list.
- **Exception:** GitHub (hosting, GitHub Pages, Gists) is permitted — we cannot avoid it.
- Check [TechForPalestine boycott dataset](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/boycott-israeli-tech-companies-dataset) and [Boycat app](https://boycott.bdsmovement.net) when unsure.
- Prefer alternatives from those resources when a dependency or service is flagged.
