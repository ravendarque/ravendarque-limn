# Getting Started

Two paths. Pick one.

---

## Path 1: Configurator (the easy one)

No YAML. No git. Just a form and a download.

1. Open the [configurator](https://ravendarque.github.io/ravendarque-limn/configurator.html)
2. Fill in your name, bio, theme, and links
3. Click **Download zip**
4. Deploy the folder — GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, whatever you like
5. Swap `avatar.jpg` for your photo (or leave the placeholder)

> **Deploy:** See [Deploying](Deploying) for step-by-step guides (Netlify, Cloudflare, GitHub Pages, Vercel).

---

## Path 2: Release zip (hands-on)

You want to edit YAML yourself. Fair enough.

1. Grab the [latest release zip](https://github.com/ravendarque/ravendarque-limn/releases)
2. Edit `config.yaml` — profile, theme, tiles
3. Steal from `examples/` for each tile type
4. Deploy — see [Deploying](Deploying)
