# Config Basics

`config.yaml` tells Limn what to show. Three sections:

```yaml
profile:     # Who you are
theme:       # How it looks
tiles:       # What you're sharing
```

---

## YAML quick reference

- **Indentation matters.** Use spaces (not tabs).
- **Colons** separate label from value: `name: Avery Storm`
- **Hyphens** start list items: `- type: heading`
- **Quotes** around text are optional unless you have special characters.

Follow the examples and you'll pick it up.

**Next:** [Profile](Profile) · [Themes](Themes) · [Tiles](Tiles)
