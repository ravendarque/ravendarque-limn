# Config Basics

`config.yaml` is the whole show. Three bits:

```yaml
profile:     # Who you are
theme:      # How it looks
tiles:      # What you're sharing
```

## YAML in 60 seconds

- **Indentation matters.** Spaces, not tabs. Two spaces per level.
- **Colons** link label to value: `name: Avery Storm`
- **Hyphens** start list items: `- type: heading`
- **Quotes** — use them when you've got colons, hashes, or special chars. Otherwise you can skip.

You'll pick it up from the examples. Promise.
