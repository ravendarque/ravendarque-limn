# Git workflow

- **Never commit directly to main.** Always create a feature branch first.
- **Branch naming:** `feature/thing` or `fix/thing` (e.g. `feature/configurator`, `fix/wiki-sync`)
- **Flow:** Create branch → make changes → commit → push → open PR → merge after review
- When starting work, create and checkout the branch before editing. When done, push and create the PR.
