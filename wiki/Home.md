## What is Limn?

- **Your name and photo** (or initials)
- **A short bio**
- **Tiles**: links, text, images, a calendar, YouTube/Spotify embeds

Everything is controlled by `config.yaml`. No build step, no database, no monthly fees.

**Who is this for?** Creators, freelancers, musicians — anyone who wants a simple "link in bio" page.
